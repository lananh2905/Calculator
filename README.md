# Basic Calculator app ðŸ‘‹

This is a **Basic Calculator** project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

**1. Install app**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lananh2905/Calculator.git
   cd Calculator
   npm install
   ```

**2. Start the app**

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
**Note:** If it still doesn't work, it may be due to the router configuration â€” this is common for public networks. You can work around this by choosing the Tunnel connection type when starting the development server, then scanning the QR code again.

   ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel
   ```
